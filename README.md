I'm a Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, and Cyber Security Specialist of 5 years. I can't go without writing clean, efficient, and scalable code, unless I save it and come back ðŸ˜¸.
I use TypeScript as my primary language for web and Node.js development along with either Angular or Next.js as my framework depending on the requirements. For general purpose programming,
I have to choose from my favorites: Java and Python.
